# Mandelbrot-Orbits-3D
This online program shows a novel view of the Mandelbrot Set, with the orbits projected out into 3D. Orbits are the sequences of the iterated function z2 + c, where c is the point in the complex plane being tested for membership of the M-set, and z starts at 0+0j. Those that stay bounded are in the set, those that shoot off are not. If you draw several of them in the complex plane it soon gets cluttered, so I flip out either the x-coordinate around the orbit's origin, or the y-coordinate. If you plot the orbit of every point c selected the picture still gets crowded, so I select from a grid of sub-points, shown in the display by red balls (as opposed to white). The user can select the grid size and offsets. A small grid size may slow the program noticeably! They can also select which coordinate to flip. Tip: zoom in close!
